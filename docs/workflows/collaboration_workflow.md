# ReXia.AI CollaborationWorkflow Class

## Overview

The CollaborationWorkflow class implements a workflow that utilizes team collaboration and tool usage for task completion. It's designed to be used within an Agent instance and extends the functionality of the BaseWorkflow class.

## Class Attributes

- `llm`: The language model used by the workflow
- `task`: The task to be performed
- `verbose`: Flag for enabling verbose mode
- `channel`: The collaboration channel for communication
- `team_work`: The team worker component
- `tool`: The tool worker component

## Methods

### `__init__(self, llm: Any, task: str, verbose: bool = False, max_attempts: int = 3) -> None`

Initializes a CollaborationWorkflow instance with the following parameters:

- `llm`: The language model
- `task`: The assigned task
- `verbose`: Flag for verbose mode (default: False)
- `max_attempts`: Maximum attempts for model responses (default: 3)

### `_run_task(self) -> None`

Internal method that executes the main workflow process:

1. Sets the task status to WORKING
2. Runs the tool component if tools are available
3. Runs the team work component
4. Sets the task status to COMPLETED

### `run(self) -> None`

Public method to initiate the workflow execution.

## Usage

To use the CollaborationWorkflow with an Agent:

```python
from rexia_ai.workflows import CollaborationWorkflow
from rexia_ai.agent import Agent

llm = ...  # Your language model instance
task = "Collaborate on a research project and summarize findings."

agent = Agent(
    llm=llm,
    task=task,
    workflow=CollaborationWorkflow,
    verbose=True
)

result = agent.invoke()
print(result)
```

This workflow enhances task-solving capabilities by incorporating team collaboration and tool usage, making it suitable for complex tasks that require multiple steps or expertise.
